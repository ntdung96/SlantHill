AFS 5 QUICKSTART


Before starting please make sure that your project is set to use the linear color space:
- Open Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings
- Set "Color Space" to "Linear"

You also have to assign the Afs deferred lighting shaders – otherwise all foliage will just show up "pretty colorful":
- Open Edit -> Project Settings -> Graphics
- Under "Built-in shader settings" change "Deferred" to "Custom shader", then assign the "Afs_Internal-DeferredShading" shader (located in "Shaders" -> "Resources").
- Also change "Deferred Reflections" to "Custom shader" and assign the "Afs_Internal-DeferredReflections" shader (located in "Shaders" -> "Resources").

As some grass models rely on import scripts which are part of this package they won't be processed correctly when you just import the package.
This will lead to some grass models floating around. In order to solve this problem simply reimport the folder "Demos", quit Unity and restart it again.

Now you should be fine to explore the demos and use the package.
